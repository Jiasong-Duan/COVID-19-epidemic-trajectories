# COVID-19-epidemic-trajectories
Objective: To discover different epidemic trajectories of COVID-19 by using data from Korea. This project contains the related program and data of the research conducted by Yu et al[1]. In this study, Geeralized Additive Model (GAM)[2] was employed to explore distinctive trajectories of COVID-19 epidemic by gender and age.
Data description: The data was gotten from the public source (accessed on May 2nd), which was gathered from the daily report of Korea Center for Disease Control[3]. The patients' confirmed date, age, gender information were used in the analysis. We observed the epidemic started on Feb 19, thus the data before Feb 19 were excluded. And because almost all cases from Daegu province were missing due to the limited access, the cases from Daegu were excluded. Three cases without confirmed date information were also excluded. Then there were 3349 subjects for the analysis of overall trajectory. To explore the different trajectories by gender and age, the gender was classified as female and male groups, and age (in years) was grouped as 0-19, 20-39, 40- 59, 60 and above. Those with missing gender information (n=78) or missing age information (n=86) were exluded.   
Program description: There are two parts in the program. One is to discover the distinct epidemic trajectories by gender groups and by age groups. The other one is to investigate overall epidemic pattern and select the best fitted model between Poisson model and Negative Binomial model. In both parts, The daily new cases were firstly fitted by model along with date, then prediction was made based on the fitted model. The observed counts, fitted curves were plotted in one plot for each group for better understanding the epidemic patterns. 
Software and Packages: The analysis was completed by R software[4], the package mgcv[5], foreign[6], dplyr[7], ggplot2[8], data.table[9], incidence[10] were used.
